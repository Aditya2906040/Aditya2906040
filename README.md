## 🛠️ Key Projects

### 🌿 Greenhouse Monitoring & Management System
An IoT-based system using **ESP8266**, **DHT11**, **soil moisture**, and **LDR sensors** to automate a greenhouse. It controls **fan**, **bulb**, and **water motor** actuators based on environmental readings and displays real-time data on an **I²C LCD**.

### 🅿️ Smart Parking Lot System
Arduino-based solution to monitor vehicle entry/exit using **IR sensors** and operate a **servo motor-controlled barrier**. Slot status is displayed live on an **I²C LCD**, providing a simple embedded parking management experience.

### 📂 C++ File Server *(Work in Progress)*
A terminal-based file sharing system using **TCP sockets** that enables upload, download, and file listing between clients and a C++ server. Future versions aim to support GUI, directory transfer, and LAN-wide access.
